This collection showcases an array of data-driven projects that I've developed. It is presented in the format of Jupyter Notebooks and PDF presentations.

If you found these projects interesting and would like to discuss the portfolio further, explore potential work opportunities, or explore collaboration possibilities, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
